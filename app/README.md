QAMEL (Question Answering on Mobile Devices) is a mobile application that is able to answer the user's typed and spoken questions in offline mode i.e., without a  connection to a powerful server and it can also answer the questions also in online mode. For the offline QA evaluation, we used dataset based on questions about Cologne. The evaluation results can be found here https://drive.google.com/file/d/1T4RTFFSV3oUAqlfcAFCfQVN5Yl8BP8vV/view?usp=sharing The OQA algorithm was able to answer 32 out of 44 questions on the mobile device (72% accuracy).
